# Data card with wordcloud chart and metadata

## Prerequisites

The app uses **highcharts-react-official** package as a dependency so make sure you have **node**, **NPM** and **React** up to date. For further information, please refer to highcharts [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts-react-official#getting-started).

-  `node` 8.11.3+
-  `npm` 6.4.1+ or similar package manager
-  `react` 16.8+
-  `highcharts` 6.0.0+

## Installation steps

### The following steps are the same for all operating systems:

1. clone the project to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioanatatu/wordcloud.git
```

2. in the terminal cd into the project directory
3. to install required dependencies run:

```bash
npm install
```

4. to start the react app run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open a tab in your browser window with the app. This project uses PORT 3005 to avoid conflicts with React's default PORT 3000.

5. to run tests open a new terminal tab and run:

```bash
npm test
```
